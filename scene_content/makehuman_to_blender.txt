Isses[solved/unsolved] and Observations:

1. [observation] Human character can be easily imported through makehuman plugin in blender and socket interface in makehuman program but without rig.

2. [observation] Blender exchange exporter is not available in default makehuman program. But its hosted by makehuman exchange repository - follow this page for more details - https://bitbucket.org/Diffeomorphic/mhx2-makehuman-exchange/src/default/

3. [solved] Changed makewalk addon load.py file line 172 from context.scene.update() into context.view_layer.update()

	Note: for possible available addons from makehuman and blender https://bitbucket.org/Diffeomorphic/    [wortks with b28 affirmed by a develpoer in forum]

4. [solved] Import mhx2 in blemnder 2.8 throws error ::
	
	Solution: made Changes in C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.80\scripts\addons\import_runtime_mhx2\materials.py", line 160, in buildMaterialCycles.
		Changes were suggested by https://developer.blender.org/rBA73df2edf635eee24a2c7a67068acd4d9410de9e5

5. [unsolved]  Target armature Male_basic does not match armature MH-Officia, but male armature from accad doesn't work at all. 
	Need to work with the source code.

Experiments:

1. Export makehuman character with bones and walk cycle to blender ::

	Hint: use maketarget and makewalk addons from blender

	Result: It works. Motion capture files .bvh files are needed. I downloaded Ohio State University ACCAD page [https://accad.osu.edu/research/motion-lab/mocap-system-and-data]

		Steps 
        	a) Import Model from Make Human community program eith through manual saving and loading mhx2 format or loading the human through server socket.
		b) Select Armature and select 'load ans retarget' option to load motion capture (.bvh) file.
	
	Open Issues - Arms are twisted with default skeleton and also with CMU skeleton (more evident on this)
 

Pipeline:
